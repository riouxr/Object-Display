# Object-Display
Object Display is a fast and easy way to change the display mode of an object from bounding box, wireframe or textured.

Once installed, it will appear on the viewport's tool tab.

You can apply it per object or for the entire scene. If you go per object you obvisouly need to select it, or them, first.
